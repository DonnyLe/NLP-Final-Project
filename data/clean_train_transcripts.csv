Process-rec-072,This looks like a mother that is distracted. She's got the sink overflowing with water while she's doing dishes. She's no doubt got the kids driving her crazy one boy on a step stool reaching into a cookie jar. Looks like the stool's falling over. So he's going to fall and maybe bunk his head as a little sister's asking for a cookie and she's kind of laughing. And it is just a very chaotic scene.

We have mom stood at the sink washing up and the sink is all flowing onto the floor, causing a perhaps a potential slip hazard. our potential flooding if she doesn't turn the taps up. We have two children who are trying to get to a cookie jar on the top shelf of one of the cupboards. The girl stood on the floor reaching up for cookie whilst the boy is stood on a stool which is starting to tip over and he has his hand in the cookie jar. So the stool is starting to tip over and it looks like he could end up falling on the floor when it does. Mum's the sink is near the window and we can see out of the window that there's what looks like a nice garden and we can see that there's some cups and a plate on the side either to wash up or to be washed up.

Process-rec-063,"Well in this picture you're seeing a family lady at washing the dishes and the water is overflowing into the floor. She's busy wiping one of the dishes clean with a towel and she's got the window open. Not much going on outside. There's some dishes left on the counter. And as you move into the picture, you see there's a young boy about to fall off of a stool and he had to use to get up into the cookie jar. He's got a cookie in his left hand as a young girl has her hand out stretch trying to grab the cookie in his hand. and the young boys grabbing another cookie and he's losing his balance and that's the end of this ","Party pizza, pan, potato, property, physical, paper, product, pans, pots, pictures, paintings, popperies, potatoes, ","Horses, cats, dogs, sheep, lands, goats, ponies, envelopes, elephants, hyenas, cougars, tigers, lions, bears, wildebeest, raccoons, opossums, squirrels, monkeys, orangutans, dinosaurs, teradactyls, turtles, "
Process-rec-106,"There is a girl exclaiming surprise at the boy who is standing on the stool which is tipping over and he is about to fall. They look as though they were both trying to get a biscuit from a biscuit jar or a cookie jar which is in a cupboard. They had to use the stool because the cupboard is quite high. the lid of the cookie jars off. Meanwhile, mum, who is standing with her back to them, is obviously thinking about something other than what she's doing, because the dish that she is wiping and drying indicates that she has forgotten that she has left the taps on and that the sink is overflowing onto the floor. It looks like it might be a nice day because the window is open and the garden looks as though it is well kept. There are some other items that have either been washed or are waiting to be washed and I would say that the room is more than likely to be a kitchen. There are seven covers on the underneath the worktop and there is one covered with two doors, one of which is open.

The window is open and there's a garden beyond. on the counter next to the sink there are two cups and a plate and she's drying a plate she's wearing an apron and a dress there are two children are one is on a stool which is tilting at a dangerous angle trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar And I assume his sister is holding her hand out because obviously she wants one of the cookies as well.

Process-rec-034,"It seems to be a woman, probably a mother, standing at the sink, washing the dishes. She's left the tap on and the sink is overflowing and forming a puddle under the sink which she's standing in. The kitchen sink is in front of a window. It looks out onto what could be a front or a back garden and the left of her is a building which could be a garage or a barn or No, actually, it's past the house because you don't see curtains hanging in there. She's drying or washing the plates and on the counter in front of her a couple of cups and another plate. Standing behind her are two children, a boy and a girl. The girl has got short socks and short flat shoes and a short skirt. Her brother or the male child is standing on a stool which is toppling over and just on two legs so I think it's all going to end very badly. He's got his hands in cookie jar. It looks like this pile of four or five very nice chocolate chip cookies or chip cookies. The lids off and he's got a cookie in his left hand. He looks like he's trying to take one with his right for the little girl, but I suspect in a moment the stalls going to topple over, he might take the jar with him. I'm really not sure why the mom's letting the sink overflow, except because I think she must be very distracted in some way.

Meanwhile, her children are trying to get into the cookie jar. There's a boy standing on a stool which is tipping over and the little girl reaching up to him while he's trying to pass down the cookie. She's got, the lady is standing by the window. Looks like it looks out onto her garden where there seems to be a little pathway. The window's half open. She's got curtains that are draped at the window with tiebacks on both sides. She's got cupboards around the... just gone. She's got cupboards, a cupboard units around the bottom. There seemed to be about, well there's one, two, three, four, five, six, six with, well three that you can see with door handles on. but it's like probably six cupboards under the window and then this looks like there's some more cupboards going around the corner and then there's another cupboard where the boys reaching up to the cookie jar. The curtains have a sort of frill long atop. The lady's wearing a dress and a pinnacle and shoes. The little boys wearing a t-shirt and shorts and shoes and socks and the little girl is wearing a dress or it could be a t-shirt and a skirt and she's got shoes and socks on and little girl has sort of blondish shoulder length hair sorry it's gone again and yeah blondish shoulder length hair the boys got short hair And I think I've already said he's wearing a t-shirt with shorts.

Process-rec-085,"Okay, this looks like a poster for hidden dangers are very visible dangers in the kitchen. There is the boy falling off the chair reaching into the cookie jar that's about to tumble down. There's the woman standing there with the dishes overflowing. She's standing on water, so I suppose there's a slip. Well, concern of slippage. She's looking at the window onto a back garden with the window open. Are they concerned about burglary? I don't think this shall be, because nobody's going to go into that kitchen with her stand there and the water flowing out. There are cupboards under the sink. There are some dishes, the size of the sink looks way too small. Looks like the hammers are missing on the cupboard. So maybe that's why they're keeping the cookie jar in the top shelves because that looks as old. There's at least one handle that seems to be seen there. The girl is laughing at her brother because she wants a cookie, but she's also seems to be shushing them up as though they don't want their mom to know what's happening. He's got the lid off, the jar, it's sideways and he has a cookie in his hand ready to give to her sister who has her hand out to receive it. ","Big piece, pepper.

Process-rec-016,as a lady in her kitchen doing her washing up she's drying a plate with a tea towel and the water is just pouring out the tap and going on to the floor causing a splash and a mess on the floor and her two children are going into the cupboard to get a cookie out the jar he stood on a stool but the stool is only on two legs instead of three so it looks as if he's going to fall off at any minute which isn't very good because he'll fall and bump his head and his sister is next to him reaching out to get the um... biscuit from him the lady doesn't look very happy either she looks as if she's got a cross expression on her face ,"Parrot, Penguin, Petunia, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay, Pay Mmm.

Process-rec-150,"Okay, so the lads trying to get into the cookie jar, passing them to his sister, I'm guessing, but he's about to fall off the stool.

Process-rec-024,Looks like Mum is washing the pots but not really concentrating on what she's doing. She's left the taps on and the water is spilling onto the kitchen floor. The children are messing about at the other side of the kitchen behind the mum and trying to get into the cookie jar. They've got into the cookie jar but the boy has stumbled on the stool and is in the process of falling over. A little girl is trying to get the cookie off him as he's falling over and she seems to be laughing. but Mum doesn't look very happy at all.

Process-rec-146,"Right, it's a photograph of a drawing a kitchen. There are two children, a young girl and a boy. The boy is climbing on a chair to get some biscuits out of the cookie jar. The chair is about to fall over. He's got so many hands ready to pass him down to the little girl. The mother is there. She's doing the washing up, but she's obviously not paying much attention because the sink is overflowing. She's drying one dish. She's wearing an apron. There's some plates on the work surface next to her. The window is open. The curtain's are drawn back. You can see out into the garden with as a pass and various plants. You can see another window. The little girl is wearing a skirt and a t-shirt. The little boy is wearing shorts and t-shirt. The lady is wearing a dress with, I think it's possibly an apron over it. She has short hair. The little girl has sort of shoulder hurt lens hair. The little boy has short hair. He's passing some cookies down to the little girl. I think I've probably already mentioned that. Let me see, there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cupboards underneath the work surface. There are three cupboards on top, one of which has got the cookie jar in it, which the boy is taking things out of it. Out in the garden, so you can see some trees, a past, grass, Possibly another house in the background as well. I can see some curtains and another window. The lady is standing in the water. So she's not paying much attention to what she's doing. She must be looking at something really interesting. She must have very wet feet. The little boy has socks and shoes on. They appear to be for the socks, but they'll be falling down. The little girl also has socks and shoes on. Let me see what else can I see. I think that's probably about everything. Let me see, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cupboards under the work surface and one, two, three, four, so one, two, three above it. The curtains are held back in place. I think I've probably already mentioned that there's not a great deal there that I can see really. The little girl is sort of leaning over backwards slightly. she's reaching a hand up to take the cookie from the little boy. No, that's pretty much it the night and see.

Process-rec-023,"There are three people in the picture, a woman drawing dishes, a boy climbing on a stool that's tipping over and he's taking cookies from a jar on the top shelf and there's a girl standing next to him reaching out apparently to take a cookie and she's pointing to her mouth, but maybe just giggling or laughing. The sink that the woman is standing at is overflowing with water that's flooding the floor. On the worked up of where the sink is, there's two cups and a plate. The curtains are parted. The window is open. And through the window can be seen the garden and what looks like an extension or conservatory or some other building. There's a lawn and a tree. The window has window bars. glazing bars I should say. There are one two three four five under counter units and one cupboard that the cookie jar is in. The lid is off the cookie jar and as I said the boy is taking cookies out of it. He has one cookie in his left hand which He may be passing to the little girl who may be his sister.

The woman, one of them is or two boats of the mother and she's washing up and she's letting the water go over the sink and obviously holding a float in the kitchen and trying to think what I can see. I can see something out of the garden but I'm not sure if it's a dog or a pig or something. I'm not really sure. I practice more. No, no, it's not. It's a hedge. And then there's a...

A girl who is probably his sister is reaching up to get a biscuit that he's got out of the jar. There's a mother by the sink. She's not looking at what the children are doing. She's probably just done the washing up. But she must have left a tap running or a plug in the sink because water is overflowing from the sink.

Process-rec-055,"So there is a picture of a, I don't know how to argue, perhaps a family. There's a mother, two children. The mother is standing by a window, the window open. She's washing up a plate. She could perhaps be arguing with daydreaming or distracted because she's washing up late and as she's doing it, the sink is overflowing. So she may be distracted when she's thinking about turning the tap off. And the other way to know how to argue with this is distracted. is because she's also got the two children who, if they are in the background, kind of doing dangerous things. So one of them is standing on a stool in order to be able to get to a cupboard which is open and to access a cookie jar, which is on the top shelf. They're also trying to pass it down to a girl as well, perhaps their sister, and that might be the reason that they've kind of gone off balance as they're doing it when they're taking the cookies out. outside the window, it looks like you've got a tree, a bush and it's kind of showing part of the neighbours garden as well. There are a number of different cupboards in the room, some of these are at lower level, there's some at high level. On the side of the sink there are different plates, there's different cups there as well. There's also in the curtain, you can see that one curtain is tied back Perhaps the other one isn't, but you can't tell because the views kind of obscured from where the lady's standing. I think she perhaps has got an apron on as well, whilst she's doing the washing up. The water where it's overflowing is splashing off the side as it goes down into falling up pool as well. So perhaps it's been on for a while. It's not just started to overflow. On the cookie jar you can see the lid open and that you can see the cookies in there as well as it being labelled as a cookie jar. The child I think they've got one in their hand already and they're going for a second one that they're passing on. The girl has got socks on and kind of sandal shoes and the boy perhaps got boots on. It's hard to tell what there are. The mum or whoever she is has got shorts or bob hair and the girls perhaps got a bit longer and I think she's got a fringe as does the mum.

Process-rec-071,"So there is a scene in a kitchen. There are three people, a mother, and what likes two children, where one of them is on top of a stool trying to get cookies out of a cookie jar, whilst the mother is at the scene doing dishes, drying up a plate, but the sink's overflowing. There's a garden outside with a pathway, some grass. It's like another house and a tree in the distance. At the window, there are curtains Um, either side of it and the window is openly into the outside.

The cookie jar has its lid off, but it looks a bit so full that the lid couldn't even fit on. Outside the window, which is curtains, which are held back by some kind of rope, there's a garden where you have some kind of dress or, and the window itself is open. You can't see a great detail in the garden, though it looks like there are maybe grass and trees out there. Maybe I'm in playing that.

The girl who's standing on the floor has her arm towards her brother, I suppose, asking for a cookie, and he's getting more cookies out of the jar. Out of the window, in front of the overflowing sink, there is a picture of a garden which has a footpath and some hedges, and another part of the house can be seen outside.

He's handing a biscuit down to a little girl standing on the floor. There's curtains at the window of the kitchen. It's covered on the wall. There's cupboards all the way around.

At the same time, he's reaching some cookies from a jar in the cupboard to hand down to a girl who's standing on the floor. So possibly they are related, maybe brother and sister, while it looks as though mum is busy working. I think she's doing the washing up actually. But it looks as though there's been an accident and the taps won't turn off. So the water is spilling over from the sink onto the floor and she's standing in a puddle of water. At the same time, she's continuing to dry a plate that presumably she's washed. Outside there looks to be through the window, there looks to be some trees and possibly a lattice fence.

The window is open and you can see a path and another house maybe and a bit of garden. There's two kids so it looks to be a boy or a girl and the boy stood on a stool and he looks like he's pinching some cookies out the cookie jar which is on the top shelf of the high cupboard. I know it's like he might be passing one to what I assume is his sister but at the same time this stool looks as though it's on it's on the edge of its legs and it might be, it is tipping over. I'm not sure if his sister's eating a cookie or she's laughing at him. The cupboard door is open. All the other cupboard doors are shut. There looks to be a cup and saucer, maybe a bowl and a plate on the side that what I assume is the mum looks as though she's drying up the plates. Yeah, I don't know if a little girl should be wearing a skirt or if it looks quite short or whether it's just like a long top and she might be wearing leggings or maybe their ankle socks. It's in black and white and it's just a line drawing so it looks quite difficult to just see there's quite a lot of detail. Outside there looks to be a tree, maybe some bushes. The curtains are at the window in like a sash kind of way and looks like the window is a yeah kind of pushed up which is open and it's got like a square grid on the windows and mum looks like she's got quite a short hair you know kind of a short bob The boy looks like he might have dark hair and just the way that it shaded.

The little boy looks like he's reaching up high for a jaw, a cookie jaw it looks like to pass down one of them to the little girl, but in the process it looks like the stool is going to fall over. They've also got the cupboard door wide open. There is a lovely wide picture window in front of the kitchen sink which is overflowing. It has two taps and through the window I can see another house with Georgian windows. It looks like the mother has got a tea towel and she's drying one of the plates and she's stood in a pool of water where the sink is overflowing. To the side it looks like there's a plate and two cups above a cupboard with two handles. The little girl is wearing ankle socks and a skirt and she's got, I would guess blonde shoulder length hair.

I can't see a lot else as you can talk about. The mother's washing the pasta, I think, probably said that. And the cook and sauté and plate on the worktop.

Process-rec-013,"Oh, it looks a bit like a disaster zone. There are lots of things happening that shouldn't be. The woman is standing in water. The sink is overflowing. The child is about reaching for the cookie jar, the cookie jar, and the jar are both about to double. Looks like they're living in suburbia or somewhere, looking at a window. The woman is trying dishes. She's wearing an apron. The child is either a dirty girl, seems to be either encouraging or concerned about her brother, who is a consumer brother, who is about to fall over. It's presumed the daylight since the action seems to be happening with the curtains open. There are dishes being washed and well, not in the sink. There are dishes sitting on the homicide board. So it looks like a kitchen area. I see kind of cupboards. What else do I say? A plate? Well, I'm trying to play it. It looks dated. It looks as though it's almost 1950s, 16s or something like that. There's a garage maybe on the side of the house or maybe it's a house next door. There's a pathway leading out of it. There's a bit of a shrubri shone and you can see also see a tree and kind of what looks like a hedge through the window. And there's a Elmesh on the curtain and the curtains are also tiebacks. The perspective seems wrong in terms of the sink itself. I'm trying to do anything else. Presumably, it's also, it isn't winter, it is either spring, summer, autumn, because people in it are clothing and what looks like summer wear.

The boy is standing on a stool and he has climbed the stool to go and get a cookie out of the cookie jar and he is handing one down to the girl standing on the floor. On the right hand side of the kitchen there is a window which appears to be open with curtains drawn back. The lady is drying dishes or washing dishes, probably drying dishes. The sink seems to have water overflowing onto the floor. Next to the sink are two cups. and a plate. All the bottom cupboards are closed. They have upright horizontal, no vertical handles. There is no colour in the picture. Through the window you can see either part of the house or another house. There's a hedge in front of the house. There is a path going round the house.

The son is climbing up on the stool which is falling over and the little girl is waving her arm about something and intends to say something perhaps about that. For the mother or the woman at the sink, the water has come over the top because the plug has obviously been put in and the tap has meant that it's pouring out onto the floor and nobody seems to notice.

There's a boy trying to get up to the cookie jar and the top shelf, the cabinet door for some reason comes out of the square over the drawing. He's falling off of his stool while a little girl laughs at him. There's a woman at the sink she's washing her dishes and for some reason completely oblivious to the fact that her sink and entire kitchen seems to be on a slant because not only is it just spilling over onto the side but it's specifically spilling onto the floor and that's quite the hazard and I think I don't think that would that would get away with building regs, to be honest. You can see the outdoors they've got. I was about to say a garden, but it looks more like a path that goes around and nearby house.

He's got a hold of a cookie jar, so it looks as though that's going to fall out of the shelf of the overhead cupboard where he falls over backwards. There's a woman looking like she's doing the washing up but left the tap running and the water is flowing over the edge of the sink onto the floor. Looks like there's obviously some malfunction with the with the waste overflow pipe in the sink because it should contain excess water rather than allowing it to go over the top edge of the sink. It looks as though she's got her feet in the water, so I guess that's going to make the floor slippery and put her in peril of slipping. She's drawing a dish with a cloth, but if she slips, that dish is likely to fall on the floor and break and could be dangerous. I think at the moment that's probably about as much as I can see in terms of hazards. Possibly the young girl is close to where the cookie jar is likely to fall out of the cupboard so she might actually get involved in some of the dangers going on within that scenario.

Process-rec-109,"Well, it's a kitchen where the mother is washing the dishes and drying up plates. The sink is overflowing because the tap is running and the water is spilling onto the floor. The window is open. Look out looking out onto a garden and ask her. On the left hand side of the picture is a cupboard, a wall cupboard with a cookie jar in it and two children trying to get at the cookies in the jar. The boy and the girl, the boy, is standing on a stool reaching for the cookies, but the stool is beginning to tip over. And he's passing cookies to the girl who is standing next to the stool. The mother appears to be wearing an apron of some sort. Through the window, you can see a garden and another house or an extension to this house with a bushing front of it, and the path going past it. Beyond which is a hedge and tree.

Process-rec-153,"The sink is overflowing. The woman doing the washing up hasn't appeared to have noticed. A boy is falling off a stool trying to get into the cookie jar, possibly on behalf of his sister. The curtains are drawn back. There's quite a nice garden view. The kitchen is kind of interestingly clean and modern. But it's a rather surreal image actually. It suggests a negligent mother who's not paying attention to her children or the washing up. Maybe there's a lover somewhere in the picture, say, out of the picture. It's an interesting one. That's as much as I've got to say about it.

Process-rec-152,"Right, boy in a girl, boy on a stool, which is falling over, girl reaching up, they've got to a cookie jar, it's handing her a cookie. It looks like it's going to fall on his back. Mums are drying the pots, the sinks fall on this water, pooling on the floor. Mum seems oblivious, kids are oblivious. There's a lot of health and safety issues at stake. There's some pots there that look as if they've been dried. And then looking through the window, there's a bit of a driveway and a bit of a garden. There's sort of like square panel window, there's some curtains with tie bikes, there's about eight cupboards, the one that's with the cookie jar, is a jar. They seem to be quite happy the boy and the girl at the moment till he breaks his neck. Yeah, there's lots of issues going off there. Mum's making sure that the parts are clean. Interesting to see that it's a woman who's drying the parts and doing the parts and looking after the children rather than a man. I suppose that's par for the curse. I can see some trees in the back ground through the window. I can see what looks like the roof of another house. And I can see it looks like shrubs, but it could be people in the distance. Yes, mum even though she's standing in the pool of water, It's totally oblivious and she looks like she's come off the old fairy washing up liquid adverts and she's sort of posing there. Cookie jar is absolutely enormous but judging by them they're not part of the obesity crisis that the two children are quite slim. It looks quite a dated picture, probably 1950's, 1960's, circa. I don't know whether that water's hot or cold, but if it's hot, then she could burn herself. I can see some handles on the cupboard doors. And yeah, she's got like a sleeveless dress on and an old-fashioned like penny over the top of it, knee length skirt and sort of little pumps on and she's got a hair sort of tour ears in a sort of bob with a fringe. She doesn't look like she's got makeup on, she's not wearing glasses. I can't see that she's wearing any bracelets, earrings or jewelry at all.

Process-rec-058,So on the left hand side you've got what looks like a young girl with a finger on her mouth or near her mouth and her left arm reaching upwards towards her brother who appears to be stood on top of a stool which is leaning backwards as he's reaching for a cookie jar which is on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet and in his left hand he seems to be passing the young girl a cookie and his right hand is holding onto the cookies in the cookie jar and then as you come into the centre it seems like it's the corner of the cabinets in the kitchen and then the right hand side of the image is a mother who is washing the dishes. She's got a towel in her right hand and she's wiping a plate. She's in a short dress with what looks like an apron around her waist and like ballet shoes and the sink is overflow in water onto the floor and over the cabinets and on the right hand side of that is a couple of dishes which have probably already been washed and then in front of her is a windowsill where you can see a bush and another part of a house either her own or a different house. ,"purple, pink, pardon, pronounce, push, pull, poach, pouch, pullover, packet, parcel, Puffer Puffin Publish Pass over Plug Plus Plus Pack ","A bit fish, dog, cat, octopus, zebra, shark, whale, monkey, tadpole, seagull, crow, blackbird, hamster, lemur, tiger, lioness, alligator, crocodile.

Process-rec-097,"I would assume that the lady is the mother of the family. She is drying some dishes that she would have just washed, that she seems to have left the tap on because the sink is overflowing. Then you have two children. The girl is somehow holding her arm up. The boy has taken a set of steps or something that he can stand on and he is taking uh we would call them biscuits but he's taking cookies the American word cookie and she has her hand out in order for him to have take one from him however he's about to fall off the stool because it seems to be tilting backwards and the mother has absolutely no idea what the children are up to. She is standing in front of a window that has curtains and you can see into their garden. There's hedges, possibly a path. The curtains are held back by a loop.

The puddle on the floor is showing splashes. There's a window with two tied-back curtains through which you can see something of the outside. The lady is wearing what looks like an apron over a dress. Her hair reasonable just below chin length in a slightly old-fashioned style. Hmm.

Process-rec-070,It looks to be a chaotic family scene. The mother looks to be washing pots up. She seems somewhat distracted. She looks to have left the tap on and it's flooded everywhere. And she's standing in water. There's two children behind her trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar. The boy is standing on the stool trying to get cookies from the top of the cupboard. The stool's falling over. The little girl is standing next to him. She's holding her hand up in the air. She wants a cookie.

He has a biscuit in one hand, which it looks as though he's going to hand it to his sister. But he's balancing perilously on a stool. In fact, the stool has already started to fall over. So he's at risk of injury. Meanwhile, his mum, who's also in the kitchen, she has her back to the children so she doesn't actually know what's happening. She's not aware of the danger that her son, I'm assuming that's her son, that he might be in. She seems to be a little bit preoccupied because she's drying a dish in her hand, but the sink is actually overflowing and the water is splashing onto the floor. And it doesn't appear that she's aware of that. So she obviously has something that is preoccupying her mind.

The woman is like cleaning a plate. she actually she dries the plate with a towel but the sink is like full with water and the water is like everywhere I'm not sure what's happening outside though because there is a window there yeah and the two children there is like a boy he tries to reach the cookie jar in the in the second shelf of the I'm not sure how you say that in English, anyway. But he is on a chair. He is standing on the chair, in order to reach the guilty judge. And he is about to fall down. And maybe he's his sister.

And I'm not sure he or his sister, whom I presume the little girl is, realize what is going to happen. And mother certainly doesn't know what's going to happen. I think she's in Greenland. because not only does she not notice the children, she doesn't notice that the floor is flooding because the water is spilling out of the sink. She's wiping a plate, she's probably been doing it for quite a while if she's got her mind on something else. Out of the window, I can see what looks like another house and a path to it and possibly lawns at the side of my people's hedges. And it looks to be two cups and a plate that Mum has already dried up, but why she's left the taps running? I just don't know. Her feet will soon be wet, so she'll realise then.
